# üéØ Lead Scoring Case Study

A data-driven machine learning project aimed at improving the marketing and sales performance of an EdTech company by building a predictive model to score leads based on their likelihood to convert. This lead scoring model enables smarter lead prioritization, increases conversion rates, and helps optimize marketing efforts.

## üìå Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze historical lead data and develop a scoring system using a logistic regression model to identify high-potential leads. The model provides insights into customer behavior and supports decision-making for targeted campaigns and efficient resource allocation.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Leads.csv` ‚Äì Raw dataset containing historical lead data.
- `Leads Data Dictionary.xlsx` ‚Äì Metadata with descriptions of all features.
- `Lead_Scoring_Case_Study.ipynb` ‚Äì Main notebook containing EDA, model building, and evaluation.
- `summary_report.pdf` ‚Äì Final project report with key findings and business recommendations.
- `Lead_score_case_study_PPT.pdf` ‚Äì Presentation deck summarizing the project for stakeholders.
- `assignment_subjective_question_answers.docx` ‚Äì Subjective answers related to the case study.

## üß† Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed patterns in user behavior and interaction features.
   - Identified correlations and important trends influencing conversion.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
   - Treated missing values, removed duplicates, and handled categorical variables.
   - Performed feature encoding and scaling.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created meaningful predictors using domain knowledge.
   - Selected impactful features for modeling.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Developed a Logistic Regression model to predict lead conversion.
   - Split data into training and test sets to validate performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Used metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Interpreted model coefficients to explain business relevance.

6. **Reporting & Communication:**
   - Created a business-style report and a professional presentation for non-technical stakeholders.

## üîç Key Insights

- Leads who spent more time on the website and came from specific sources (e.g., organic search, reference) had higher conversion rates.
- Certain features such as `Total Time Spent on Website`, `Lead Origin`, and `Last Activity` had strong predictive power.
- The final model enabled the business to segment and target high-conversion leads effectively.
